# Keylogger using Python and Pynput

This is a simple keylogger script created using Python and the Pynput library. It captures keyboard inputs and logs them into a file (`log.txt`).

## Description

This Python script utilizes the Pynput library to monitor keyboard inputs in real-time. It records keys pressed by the user and saves them into a log file (`log.txt`). The keylogger stops after capturing 10 keystrokes and stores them in the log file.
